Shakespeare’s Duncan is portrayed as the quintessential king while Hartley and Hewson’s depiction of the same
 character distorts reality to serve his own desires. An ideal king should place the needs of the nation above
  his own personal gain, and the dichotomy exhibited by the two interpretations of Duncan addresses this issue.
   When SD is congratulating Macbeth and Banquo on their victory he tells them he has appointed his son as his heir.  
   “We. . . shine.” By stating that Malcolm should be morally deserving as well as merely part of a noble lineage, 
   this quotation exemplifies Duncan’s dedication to Scotland. In contrast, HH describe Duncan by saying “he. . . character.” 
   This instance specifically addresses his plan to claim Macbeth and Banquo’s victory for his own. The quotation stands 
   in stark contrast to the first because Duncan is seen as more manipulative and self-serving. He tries to distort actual 
   events to aid his own purposes and therefore abuses the power invested in the monarchy.  By choosing to alter Duncan in 
   this way, HH demonstrate his blatant abuse of power which ultimately affects how we view the actions of other characters.
